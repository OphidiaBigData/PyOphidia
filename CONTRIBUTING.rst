How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that
sacrifice their time and PyOphidia is no different.

Here are a few hints and rules to get you started:

- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst file in an alphabetical fashion.
  Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the HISTORY.rst file.
- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Don’t *ever* break backward compatibility.
- *Always* add docs for your code.
  If a feature is not documented, it doesn’t exist.
- Try to obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- Write `good commit messages`_.
- Ideally, squash_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

.. note::
   If you have something great but aren’t sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules above: **please submit a pull request anyway**!

   In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed.
   There’s absolutely nothing to fear.

Thank you for considering to contribute to PyOphidia!
